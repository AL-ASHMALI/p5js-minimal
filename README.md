# A minimal starting template for a p5.js "sketch", for CYF students

This is a minimal p5js project for CYF students who have finished the fantastic Khan Academy intro to js: drawing and anim course.

You can fork this repo to start working on your own p5.js projects.

Perhaps use it to migrate some of your favourites from your Khan Academy work (and give them their own home by deploying on netlify or github pages).
